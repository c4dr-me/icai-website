        Climate change is crucial to both healthy living and the continuation of life on
        Earth. The continuous evolution in the history of civilization has caused significant
        negative impact on the climate. Substantial research towards climate change,
        sustainability and energy optimization can mitigate a number of issues, including
        abrupt climatic change, rising temperatures, carbon emissions, greenhouse gas
        emissions, and energy waste. NCRTCES 2024 aims to identify unresolved research
        issues related to climate, energy and sustainability and to provide fresh, creative
        concepts in this area. AI trends for promoting environmental sustainability and
        efficient energy utilization is also included.
